# Mod Guidelines

The changes different mods make to your game can vary wildly, so these guidelines aim to help you understand which mods would or would not be in violation of our rules.

However, please note that any use of mods is at your own risk. It is your own responsibility to ensure any mods you use are in alignment with our rules, and do not give you a competitive advantage. If you are unsure whether you would be allowed to use a specific mod, please ask a staff member.

## Allowed Mods

### Performance mods

Mods that improve the game’s performance (such as FPS and memory usage) without changing the way the game is played, for example:

- Sodium
- Entity Culling
- DynamicFPS
- FerriteCore
- ImmediatelyFast

### Cosmetic mods

Mods that influence the way the game looks, without giving any advantage over other players or changing the way the game is played, for example:

- 3D Skin Layers
- Iris Shaders
- CIT Resewn
- Continuity

## Disallowed mods

Mods that provide unfair advantages over other players or change the way the game is played, for example:

- Hacked clients
- X-Ray
- HUD modifications that provide information that isn’t normally given, such as player positions and ore locations *(e.g. minimap mods)*
- Mods that allow you to change your perspective from what would be possible in vanilla *(e.g. ReplayMod)*
